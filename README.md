**The Problem:** With friends and family members from Maine, to California, and almost a dozen places in between, I wanted to create an application I knew my friends and family would be able to find both useful and enjoyable. I have family recipes going back a century that are delicious and very important to me and my family. I would often call my mom and ask her if she wouldn't mind going through the old cookbooks to find that special recipe that my grandma used to make, or that everyone loved that one Chistmas back in '98. EvansEats is the application where users can create a place for these super special recipes that have meant a lot to our family over the years.


## Process
This application was started in late December 2019 and is being worked on regularly. The back-end has been built out with Node.js and Express.js and is complete with testing of all endpoints. The front-end is being built in React, Redux, React-Hooks, and Sass with testing using Jest/Enzyme. Take a look at the project board for more specifics regarding the process of the application, or click on the link above to see the deployed site so far.
